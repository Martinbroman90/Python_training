Be my teacher in python: Create a step by step tutorial
for creating a game using python and kivy. So I can use
the game on my Android phone. The game should be made in
pygame and it should be a chess game were I can play against
 someone on my phone. just give me one task and give me a new
 one when im finished with the one before.


Your `main_chess.py` file looks good. You have successfully created the chessboard. Let's move on to the next task.

### Task 3: Add Chess Pieces

Now that you have the chessboard, let's add the chess pieces. Follow these steps:

1. **Load Chess Piece Images**: Download or create images for each chess piece (king, queen, bishop, knight, rook, and pawn for both black and white). Save these images in a directory named `images` within your project directory.

2. **Create a Function to Load Images**: Write a function to load these images.

3. **Place the Pieces on the Board**: Create a function to place the pieces in their initial positions on the board.

Here is the code to get you started:

```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 800))
pygame.display.set_caption("Chessboard")

# Define colors
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)

# Load images
def load_images():
    pieces = ['king', 'queen', 'bishop', 'knight', 'rook', 'pawn']
    colors = ['white', 'black']
    images = {}
    for color in colors:
        for piece in pieces:
            images[f'{color}_{piece}'] = pygame.image.load(f'images/{color}_{piece}.png')
    return images

# Draw the chessboard
def draw_chessboard():
    block_size = 100  # Set the size of the grid block
    for x in range(0, 800, block_size):
        for y in range(0, 800, block_size):
            rect = pygame.Rect(x, y, block_size, block_size)
            if (x + y) // block_size % 2 == 0:
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, WHITE, rect)
            else:
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, BLACK, rect)

# Place pieces on the board
def place_pieces(screen, images):
    # Example positions for pawns
    for i in range(8):
        screen.blit(images['white_pawn'], (i * 100, 6 * 100))
        screen.blit(images['black_pawn'], (i * 100, 1 * 100))
    # Add other pieces similarly

# Main loop
running = True
images = load_images()
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

    draw_chessboard()
    place_pieces(screen, images)
    pygame.display.flip()
```

### Steps to Follow:
1. Download or create images for each chess piece and save them in the `images` directory.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into `main_chess.py`.
3. Run the script to see the chess pieces on the board.

Once you have completed these steps, let me know, and we will move on to the next task.


Task 2: Create the Chessboard
Now that your development environment is set up, let's start by creating the chessboard. Follow these steps:
Create a new Python file: Create a new file named main_chess.py in your project directory.
Initialize Pygame: Set up the basic Pygame window and initialize the Pygame library.
Draw the Chessboard: Create a function to draw an 8x8 chessboard.
Here is the code to get you started:






import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 800))
pygame.display.set_caption("Chessboard")

# Define colors
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)

def draw_chessboard():
    block_size = 100  # Set the size of the grid block
    for x in range(0, 800, block_size):
        for y in range(0, 800, block_size):
            rect = pygame.Rect(x, y, block_size, block_size)
            if (x + y) // block_size % 2 == 0:
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, WHITE, rect)
            else:
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, BLACK, rect)

# Main loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

    draw_chessboard()
    pygame.display.flip()
